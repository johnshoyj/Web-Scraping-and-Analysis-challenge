# Web-Scraping-and-Analysis-challenge

In Part I of this challenge I scraped data from a website and parsed the html using Beautiful Soup. I then extracted article data elements, stored them in a list, and printed the list to read the article information I scraped. 

In Part II of the challenge, I again used Beautiful Soup to scrape the data from a website containing a mars data table. I extracted out the data from the table and printed it to a list. I then converted the list into a Pandas dataframe and changed the data types to prepare for analysis. Next I analyzed the table data to create four charts about the various features of Mars.
